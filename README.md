EmailWebService
===============

EmailWebService with SES in Node

======

We will take in PowerShell a result set from SQL Server, 
  transform it into a JSON and then push to this service (this is another project).
This service will take the JSON, create a HTML table for it and then 
  email it to a list of emails using Amazon SES (an AWS account is needed for this).
